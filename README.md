This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common error involving exception handling and type errors. The main script demonstrates a function that handles division by zero and type errors using try-except blocks. The solution provides an improved version of the function, adding input validation and more robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.  The improved function includes assertions to validate input types before performing calculations, making the code more robust and less prone to unexpected errors.
